			<description>Added a bunch of new links, mostly for webcomics, but one for another radio station: VRChat Pirate Radio, a follow-up to the defunct Radio New Vegas GPT (which I previously linked and removed).</description>

			<description>Fixed a bug with the audio seek bar where it would "resist" following your cursor when you clicked and dragged (it instead stuck to the current audio position), if you'd previously clicked it while the audio was paused. Also fixed a bug where a nav link would visually stay selected if you clicked one of them and then clicked Back to go to the welcome sub-page again.</description>

			<description>Added a new "featured show" feature that adds a single, random banger from the Archive to the welcome page and lets you add it to the playlist from there. Hopefully this'll give new visitors an easier time getting into Weird  Waves (the new playlist version of the app was always gonna be harder to get started with, because unlike the scheduled version there's no way to have shows pushed at you; you gotta search yourself).</description>
